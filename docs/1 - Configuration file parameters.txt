 optionally solves for leakage and polarisation angle and transfers the solutions to the target data.

calibration for APERTIF. Mode 'APERTIF' is experimental and does not include any application of system temperatures,

source model in the phase centre for each individual integration time before deriving bandpass and calibrator gains.

 on a point source in the field centre before deriving any other calibrator gains.

deep continuum image of each frequency chunk individually and stacks the images in the end weighted by their
theoretical noise.

clean 80% of the inner part of the image. Very useful if images are confused or very diffuse extended structures are
present, which are not caught by the masking. Set to 0 to switch off. This is not included anymore due to Tom's remark
on clean bias.
final_line (bool):
Produce a final line cube of the dataset. This needs at least one execution of the line step before it can produce

combines all channels in the end into a final cube or 'chunk' which produces a single cube out of each frequency
chunk and combines these chunks in the end into a final cube. 'channel' might be needed since MIRIAD assumes a linear
 behaviour of freqeuncies with velocities.
